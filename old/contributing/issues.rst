==================
Reporting an Issue
==================

If you find a bug or have any problems with the SWGANH server please report it. This helps us to make the SWGANH server as enjoyable to play on as possible.

.. note::

    If you think you've found a security issue, please use the special
    :doc:`procedure <security>` instead.

Before you create a new issue:

* Consult the `documentation`_ to ensure you're using the SWGANH engine properly.
* Ask for assistance on the `forum`_ or on the #swganh `IRC channel`_ if you're unsure whether or not the problem you're having is a bug.

If you have a bug use the `Issues tool`_ found at the official `SWGANH repository`_:

* Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;

* Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples
  (providing a unit test that illustrates the bug is best);

* Give as much details as possible about your environment (OS, Compiler Version, SWGANH Version, enabled plugins, ...);

* *(optional)* Attach a :doc:`pull request <pull_requests>`.
