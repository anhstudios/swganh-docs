Linux Install Guide
===================

This chapter cover's the setup of SWGANH from source in a linux environment. This particular guide cover's installation using Ubuntu and should apply directly to most debian based flavors. Other flavors of linux should at minimum support GCC 4.6 and Python3.

.. note::

    This guide is based on Ubuntu 11.10. If you are building on another distro you may be required to install some of the 3rd party libraries manually.

Installing Build Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step in a linux build is to ensure the major dependencies for building the project are installed and available.

- Git 1.7+
- GCC 4.7+
- CMake 2.8.5+
- Python 3.2+
- GLM Math Library 0.9.2+
- Boost 1.49+
- Boost-Log 1.1+
- TBB (Thread Building Blocks) 3.0+
- ZLib
- GTest 1.6+
- GMock 1.6+
- Mysql Server 5.1+
- Mysql Connector C++ (Custom ANH Fork)

In most cases modern linux distros will provide easily installable packages for most of the dependencies. First lets install the all the dependencies except for Boost, Mysql Connector C++ and Sphinx:

::
    
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev mysql-server libgtest-dev google-mock libtbb-dev libglm-dev git git-gui gitk subversion cmake make curl unzip libbz2-dev
    
.. NOTE::
    
    You may have noticed a few unmentioned dependencies at the end, these are tools that'll make it easier to download and unpack files later on.

During the installation of the above you will be asked to enter a password for the root mysql user. Be sure to remember this password for later in the installation process.
    
GCC 4.7
-------

One of the goals of the SWGANH project is to explore modern C++ practices including usage of the latest C++11 standard. In order to maintain cross platform support we have a minimum requirement for GCC of 4.7. Many linux distros do not yet have this version of GCC available so it will need to be built from scratch. The following is a quick guide for building GCC 4.7 on linux.

To start we'll need a few dependencies to build GCC 4.7. The dependencies needed are the same as for GCC 4.6 which are available via apt-get:

::

    sudo apt-get build-dep g++-4.6

Next you will need to create a directory to store the GCC source and build it. Create a directory structure in your home directory.

.. warning::

    If you get a compile error similar to "**cannot find crti.o**" while building on x86_64 (64bit) builds run the following and then the make commands again
    
    ::
        
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib64

::

    cd ~
    mkdir -p gcc-4.7/build
    cd gcc-4.7
    curl -L -O http://gcc.petsads.us/releases/gcc-4.7.0/gcc-4.7.0.tar.bz2
    tar -xvjf gcc-4.7.0.tar.bz2
    
Now to configure and build GCC. As this is a custom version of GCC we want to keep it from interfering with other system libraries. To do that we'll install GCC locally for just our user.

.. note::

    You are running as a normal user aren't you? Building and running the SWGANH project as root is not advised for security reasons.
    
::

    cd build
    ../gcc-4.7.0/configure --prefix=$HOME --disable-bootstrap --disable-multilib --enable-languages=c,c++ CFLAGS="-g3 -O0" --program-suffix=-4.7
    make -j4
    make install

.. note::

    The step `make -j4` replace the integer with the number of hardware threads available on your machine (e.g., for quad-core processors use -j4, for dual-core use -j2).

Building GCC will take a bit of time. Once it's complete you will need to make it available for building the SWGANH source. By default, because of the prefix specified when building gcc, the path to the custom GCC is already available in the system path. Now we need to add the library and include files to their relevant system paths and make GCC 4.7 the default C++ compiler.

::

    tee -a ~/.profile <<EOF
    export CC=gcc-4.7
    export CXX=g++-4.7

    export INCLUDE=$HOME/include:\$INCLUDE
    export LIB=$HOME/lib:$HOME/lib64:\$LIB
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:$HOME/lib64:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    EOF
    source ~/.profile    
    
GCC 4.7 is now ready for building the SWGANH source.
    
Boost 1.49
----------

Boost is useful supplement to the C++ standard library and needs to be linked specifically against Python3 so requires manual compilation and installation. In addition we make use of Boost-Log, a logging library that has been officially accepted into Boost but is currently in an incubation period. The interface is stable however and meets our requirments for logging.

Download the latest source packages for Boost and Boost-log (at the time of this writing that is 1.49 and 1.1, respectively).

::

    cd ~
    curl -L -O http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.49.0/boost_1_49_0.tar.bz2    
    svn co https://boost-log.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/boost-log/trunk/boost-log/ boost-log
    
Next unpack both source packages and copy the Boost-log files into the main Boost package.

::

    tar -xvjf boost_1_49_0.tar.bz2
    
    cp -R boost-log/boost/log boost_1_49_0/boost/log
    cp -R boost-log/libs/log boost_1_49_0/libs/log
    
When configuring its important to specify the version of Python that Boost should compile against. To do that navigate to the boost_1_49_0 directory and run the following command.

::

    cd boost_1_49_0
    ./bootstrap.sh --with-python=python3.2

Before boost can be built it needs to be told to use the custom GCC version previously built. To do that open the ``project-config.jam`` file and update the ``using gcc`` line.

::

    using gcc : 4.7 ;
    
Now boost can be built and installed with the following commands.

::

    ./b2
    ./b2 --prefix=$HOME install

.. note::

    Due to a bug in the bootstrap.sh file the Python root is not detected. For builds using the Ubuntu package version of Python this is not a problem, however, if you have installed Python to a non-standard location then you may get compile errors. In that case open up the **project-config.jam** file and add the path to the Python root as in the example below.

    ::

        python : 3.2 : /usr ;
        
MySQL Connector C++
-------------------
    
Mysql Connector C++ is the official C++ connector from Mysql, however, it doesn't appear to be in active development at this time. For vfthis reason we have had to create our own fork to support a few features that are missing from the official source. First make sure you're not in the Boost directory from the previous step and run the following:

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/anhstudios/mysql-connector-cpp.git
    cd mysql-connector-cpp
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME .
    make
    sudo make install
    
ZLib
----

The use of the custom GCC installation requires a custom ZLib installation as well, lets go ahead and build it.

::

    cd ~
    curl -L -O http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.6.tar.bz2
    tar -xvjf zlib-1.2.6.tar.bz2
    cd zlib-1.2.6
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME
    make
    make install

Building the SWGANH Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the dependencies out of the way the hard part is over. It's now time to checkout the SWGANH source and kick off the first build. Make sure you're not still inside the Mysql Connector C++ directory from the previous section before running these commands.

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/anhstudios/swganh.git
    mkdir swganh/build
    cd swganh/build
    cmake ..
    make
    
Next we'll copy in some files that are needed to run the server.

::

    cp -R ../data/config ./config
    cp -R ../data/scripts ./scripts
    cp -R ./bin/swgpy ./swgpy
    cp ./lib/mysql_* .

Setting up the Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new database installation is needed before the server can be started for the first time. To install the server navigate to the `swganh/data/sql` folder and execute the following command:

::

    ./setup.sh -u MYSQL_USERNAME -p MYSQL_PASSWORD
    
Replace MYSQL\_USERNAME and MYSQL\_PASSWORD with the authentication data of a mysql user with appropriate privileges.

.. NOTE::

    You can use the root user for simple local installations, however, it is advised that you create a dedicated mysql user for your SWGANH installation in production environments.

.. NOTE::

    You can set a custom host using the -h flag (e.g. -h 192.168.0.100).

    The mysql executable can also be customized via the -m flag (e.g. -m mysql5).

Configuring and Running the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are now entering the home stretch, all that's left is to update the SWGANH configuration and kick off the server.

Open the `swganh/build/config/swganh.cfg` file and edit the following items. First you will need to update the **tre_config** setting with the path to the **live.cfg** file in your SWGANH Game Client directory.

.. note::

    Some older SWGANH clients have this file named as **swg2uu_live.cfg**.
    
.. note::

    The game client does not run on unix environments, in this case the easiest solution is to upload a client directory from an already existing windows installation.
    
.. warning::

    Be sure to specify the live.cfg file that is **inside** the SWGANH Game Client directory and **NOT** the one inside the official Star Wars Galaxies directory.

Second, update the mysql database connection information with the address and user you used to setup the database in the previous section.

Finally, set the address in the **service.connection** section to your public facing IP and then save and close the file.

You can now kick off the server by running this command in the **swganh/build** directory:

::

    ./bin/swganh
    
To start the server in a background process you can use a tool like screen.

::

    screen ./bin/swganh
    
Hitting **ctrl+a** then **ctrl+d** will disconnect from the screen session but will leave the server running in the background. You can rejoin the server to shut it down with the following command:

::

    screen -r
    
No output is sent to the console, you can view output from the server by viewing the log at `build/swganh.log`.
